## Customization

### Adding New Nutrients

To track additional nutrients, modify the `getFoodDetails` function in `src/services/foodApi.js`:

```javascript
// Add new nutrient extraction
else if (name.includes('vitamin c')) {
  nutrients.vitaminC = Math.round(value * 100) / 100;
}
```

### Changing Theme Colors

Modify the theme in `App.js`:

```javascript
const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#your-color',
    accent: '#your-accent-color',
  },
};
```

### Adding New Screens

1. Create a new screen component in `src/screens/`
2. Add the route to the Stack Navigator in `App.js`
3. Navigate to it using `navigation.navigate('ScreenName')`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Network Error" when searching foods**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify API key is correct (if using custom key)
   - Try with a different search term

2. **App won't load in Expo Go**
   - Ensure your device and computer are on the same network
   - Try restarting the Expo development server
   - Clear Expo Go app cache

3. **Food log data disappears**
   - This shouldn't happen as data is stored locally
   - Check if AsyncStorage permissions are granted
   - Try restarting the app
